# 🃏 Blackjack CLI Game (Python)

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game built in Python. It's a beginner project created to practice fundamental programming concepts such as:

- Conditional logic and control flow  
- Loops and user input  
- Data structures (`lists`, `dicts`)  
- Randomization and shuffling  

The game follows standard Blackjack rules and is playable entirely in the terminal.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python BlackjackSim-annotated.py
3. Follow the prompts to play against the dealer:
  - Type h to hit (draw another card).
  - Type s to stay (end your turn).
4. The game will automatically handle Ace logic (11 becomes 1 if it prevents a bust).
5. You’ll be asked if you want to play again after each round.

## 🛠️ Requirements
  - Python 3.x (no external libraries needed — uses only the random module)

## 🧠 Motivation
This project was created as a first hands-on exercise in Python. It was a way to:
  - Practice structuring a procedural program
  - Handle edge cases and game logic
  - Work with lists, dictionaries, and loops
  - Explore how card games can be implemented with basic tools

---
## 🚀 Future Improvements (for fun)
  - Implement split and double down options
  - Add betting and bankroll system
  - GUI version using tkinter or a web version with Flask
  - Multiplayer support

## 📜 License

This project is open-source and free to use.
